                            <p> 
                                <b>I</b> am a(n aspiring) data scientist. I like everything about data - but my interests mainly involve
								extracting patterns from data (Data Mining), visualizing and presenting data in a easy to understand
								format (Data Visualization), analysing and understanding what the data can tell and foretell (Statistical
								Learning - Machine and Deep Learning). 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Formally I have a degree in Physics (Master of Sciences, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research
								Kolkata, India, 2017) and Statistics (Master of Sciences, Leiden University, 2021) with both my theses mainly
								involving simulation studies and method development. I am proficient in both Python and R but have also used
								other languages for course assignments or as per the requirements of the project. Being creative and an engergetic
								person, I have always earned praises from my supervisors, but what excites me most is the ability to dive into 
								new, innovative and ambitious ideas and see those ideas to fruition. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                In my free time I generally read story books or play computer games or learn a new programming language. I also 
								like to travel (my most favourite destination visited recently is Prague). Pre-Corona I was also active in sports
								specially in Basketball (represented my college in national level tournament for research institutes), have played
								cricket for several years and learnt volleyball and table-tennis at my previous institute. Apart from that I love
								swimming.
                            </p>
